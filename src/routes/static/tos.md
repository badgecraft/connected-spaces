This platform uses the services provided by Badgecraft UAB, code 302879087, address Verkiu st. 5A-59, Vilnius, Lithuania, (further – ‘Badgecraft’). Badgecraft provides services (further – ‘Badgecraft services’) to create, issue and manage digital badges in-line with the [Open Badges standard](https://openbadges.org/) and other related services. Badgecraft services are dedicated to all users (private and legal entities – further ‘Users’) regardless their legal form as long as they comply with the following Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, which establishes rules concerning processing of your personal data and can be found [here](/privacy).

1.  Badgecraft services are predominantly for the use by users older than 14 years for the purpose to engage and recognise achievements through Open Badges and other related services.

Users of the Badgecraft services will not cause offense to other users by any means; including cyber bullying, use of inappropriate and derogative language, racist, sexist, other discriminatory comments that would be deemed to threaten or demean any user or third party in any way or infringement of any applicable law. The use of offensive language as part of a username is also strictly prohibited. Discussions, topics and badge issuing that relate to discrimination are acceptable only when aiming to challenge prejudice, reduce stigma and promote equality.

3.  Uploading badge related evidence and links must be appropriate and relevant to the badge description and every effort should be made to ensure images/video footage should be deemed to be non-offensive and not inappropriate.
